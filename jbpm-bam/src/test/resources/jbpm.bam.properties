#Configuration file for jBPM5 BAM module
#allows to configure its JPA based persistence that will be used for
# both persisting information and retrieving them

#There are three ways of getting hold of EntityManagerFactory
# 1. from Drools/jBPM Environment
# 2. from JNDI
# 3. create it based on given persistence unit name
#following order is preserved when creating/getting EMF so care must be taken to enable and disable proper configuration
# for instance when JNDI based config is active environment must be disabled otherwise it will take precedence over JNDI
# according to check order 

#to use entity manager from given environment enabled by default for backward compatibility
use.environment.emf=true

# to use entity manager factory from jndi
#use.jndi.emf=true|false
# JNDI kye that will be used to look up for entity manager factory
#jbpm.bam.emf.jndi=

#name of persistence unit to be used while building entity manager factory
#optional with default value org.jbpm.persistence.jpa
#jbpm.bam.persistence.unit=
