    JA Bride : 23 July 2013
    deployment of this library as a JBoss Module is a problem
    in particular, included in this library are CDI beans (ie:  org.jbpm.runtime.manager.impl.RuntimeManagerFactoryImpl )
    at least in EAP6.1, the CDI container is not able to inject beans that have been deployed as JBoss Modules
-->
<module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.1" name="org.jbpm.jbpm-runtime-manager">

    <resources>
        <resource-root path="jbpm-runtime-manager-${project.version}.jar"/>
    </resources>

    <dependencies>
        <module name="org.jbpm.jbpm-audit" />
        <module name="org.jbpm.jbpm-human-task-workitems" />
        <module name="org.jbpm.jbpm-persistence-jpa" />
        <module name="org.jbpm.jbpm-shared-services" />
